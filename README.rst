DPA Pipeline Framework
======================

This repository represents a front-end implementation of a production pipeline framework described in a talk at SIGGRAPH 2014 titled `A Framework for Global Visual Effects Production Pipelines <https://vimeo.com/116364653>`_. The code was developed for, and is used by, the `Digital Production Arts program at Clemson University <http://clemson.edu/dpa>`_. 

This implementation is by no means complete, and the code should be considered a work-in-progress. There are quite a few moving parts and admittedly a ton of room for improvement when it comes to security and authentication, data caching, testing, etc. That said, the core pieces described in the SIGGRAPH talk have been implemented and are in use by DPA students. A few students have also contributed to this codebase and even more are extending it on production - building tools and workflows for themselves and their classmates.

If you are interested in contributing or have questions about the project, please contact `josh-t <https://github.com/josh-t>`_ or `Clemson-DPA <https://github.com/Clemson-DPA>`_.
