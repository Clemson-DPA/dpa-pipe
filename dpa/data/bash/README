The bash file in this directory is used to activate the dpa pipeline in a shell
environment. It can be sourced directly or it can be called from within a bash
function. If you plan to use a virtualenv for your dpa-pipe installation, you
can set the $DPA_VIRTUAL_ENV variable before sourcing this file and it will
activate the virtualenv for you. Also included here is a bash function called
'pipedown' that will deactivate the pipeline within your shell. 

Example of activating the pipeline in ~/.bashrc:

    ...
    export DPA_VIRTUAL_ENV="/path/to/virtualenv"        # <<< change path
    source __DPA_FILESYSTEM_ROOT__/bash/activate.bash
    ...

Alternatively, you can define a function in your .bashrc to activate:

    ...
    export DPA_VIRTUAL_ENV="/path/to/virtualenv"        # <<< change path
    pipeup () {
        # path to the 
        source __DPA_FILESYSTEM_ROOT__/bash/activate.bash
    }
    ...

Then you can type:

    # activate the pipeline
    > pipeup

    # deactivate the pipeline
    > pipedown
